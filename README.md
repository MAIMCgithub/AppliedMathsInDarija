Topics on Applied Maths in Moroccan Darija

Series of Beamer presentations on some topics in Applied Maths written in Moroccan Darija. The targetted crowd are high school students, Prépas students and Master of Engineering students.

This is a pop science personal project that I wanted to start for a long time, this is not by any means some kind of call for funds. I just hope it will make moroccan students interested in maths in general and in its applications in particular. Having a career in research is not very popular in Morocco, so I hope I can transfer my passion towards scientific research to the next generations. That's the real prize.
