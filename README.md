Topics on Applied Maths in Moroccan Darija

Series of Beamer presentations on some topics in Applied Maths written in Moroccan Darija. The targetted crowd are high school students, Pr√©pas students and 
Master of Engineering students.

This is a pop science project that I wanted to start for a long time, I hope it will make moroccan students interested in maths in general and in 
its applications in particular. Having a career in research is not very popular in Morocco, so I hope I can transfer my passion towards scientific research 
to the next generations.
